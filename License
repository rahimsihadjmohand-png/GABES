GABES is distributed under an academic-only license. This restriction is necessary because GABES depends 
on the AHMED library, which is exclusively non-commercial (see AHMED Non-Commercial Educational License 
by M. Bebendorf, 2012).

1. You may use and modify GABES for academic and educational purposes only. Examples include teaching, 
research, and personal experimentation within educational institutions.

2. You may redistribute GABES and modifications of GABES for academic purposes, but only to other eligible 
academic users (e.g., students, faculty, researchers).

3. Commercial use, including any activity for monetary gain, licensing, leasing, or integrating GABES into 
commercial products, is prohibited. 

4. Any effort to use or develop GABES for commercial purposes requires prior written permission from:
   - Rahim SI HADJ MOHAND, author of GABES (Email: Rahim.si_hadj_mohand@g.enp.edu.dz)
   - Mario Bebendorf, author of AHMED, if AHMED is used and not replaced with another library 
     (Email: mario.bebendorf@uni-bayreuth.de)

5. AHMED source modifications in GABES are limited solely to adapting the MFC GUI for progress bar updating 
instead of the console-based progress reporting originally provided in AHMED. All modified AHMED routine 
prototypes are declared in "Ahmed_Overrides.h", and their implementations are in "Ahmed_Overrides.cpp".

6. You must not remove or alter copyright notices in the source code or documentation.

7. If you modify GABES or create derivative works, you must include prominent notices describing your changes 
and the date of those changes.

8. GABES is provided "as is" with no warranties of any kind, express or implied. The author is not liable for 
any damages arising from the use of this software.
